## Performance
- **Mobile & Responsiveness Design:**
  - Make sure project is dynamic across indsutry standard break points.
  - Follow Tailwind CSS best practices 
  
- **SEO Optimization:**
  - Include meta tags on all pages using Next.js `<Head>` or `generateMetadata`.
  - Optimize for search engines and performance (e.g., aim for high Lighthouse scores).
  - Prompt Cursor: "Add dynamic SEO tags to the dashboard page."

- **Loading & Caching Strategy:**
  - Fetch data server-side with Next.js server components for initial loads.
  - Cache CoinGecko API data in Supabase (e.g., `bitcoin_prices` table) to reduce API calls.
  - Use React Query or SWR for client-side caching and real-time updates.

- **Row-Level Security (RLS):**
  - Apply RLS to all Supabase tables (e.g., `transactions`) to restrict data to authenticated users.
  - Test RLS by simulating multiple user logins.

- **Optimal Privacy:**
  - Minimize stored user data; rely on Stripe for sensitive billing details.
 
- **Storage Optimization:**
  - Store CSVs in Supabase Storage, compressing files if necessary.
  - Set a max CSV size (e.g., 10MB per file); prompt users to split larger files.

## Privacy
- **Transparent Privacy Policy:**
  - Provide a clear policy at `/privacy`, linked across the app.
  - Emphasize no data selling and minimal data collection.
  
- **Safeguards Against User Data:**
  - Store only essential data in Supabase (e.g., `user_id`, `email`).
  - Use RLS to ensure users access only their own data.
